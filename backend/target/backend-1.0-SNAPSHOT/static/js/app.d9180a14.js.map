Even if the Arctic continues to be\n                one of the fastest-warming regions of the world, it will always\n                be plunged into bitterly cold polar dark every winter. And\n                year-by-year, for all kinds of natural reasons, there’s huge\n                variety of the state of the ice.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                For a start, it does not automatically follow that a record\n                amount of ice will melt this summer. More important for\n                determining the size of the annual thaw is the state of the\n                weather as the midnight sun approaches and temperatures rise.\n                But over the more than 30 years of satellite records, scientists\n                have observed a clear pattern of decline, decade-by-decade.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                The Arctic Ocean freezes every winter and much of the sea-ice\n                then thaws every summer, and that process will continue whatever\n                happens with climate change.
